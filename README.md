# 04-Challenge-Quiz
This highlights a timed quiz for the user to play.
This application lets users play a fun quiz that pertains to questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
As the user reads throught the question, the quiz has a timer that will give the user 10 seconds to answer each question.
If the useer does not answer a question before the timer runs out, the user will get an 'incorrect' reult for that question.
At the end of the quiz, the user will see a displayed score as well as a saved 'high score' and a form to type their initials in.
Here is a screenshot of what the application looks like:
